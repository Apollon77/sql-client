# SQL-CLIENT

**sql-client** is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) library that defines
a simple and consistent abstraction for interacting with a relational database.

<!-- toc -->

## Installing

The source code and documentation for *sql-client* is available on
GitHub at
[intellinote/sql-client](https://github.com/intellinote/sql-client).
You can clone the repository via:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:intellinote/sql-client
```

*sql-client* is deployed as an [npm module](https://npmjs.org/) under
the name [`sql-client`](https://npmjs.org/package/sql-client). Hence you
can install a pre-packaged version with the command:

```bash
npm install sql-client
```

and you can add it to your project as a dependency by adding a line like:

```javascript
"sql-client": "latest"
```

to the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` part of your `package.json` file.

## Contents

*sql-client* provides the following.

### Generic Types

 * **SQLClient** - an "abstract" base class for SQL clients, offering
   a simple and consistent `connect`, `execute`, `disconnect` API.

 * **SQLClientPool** - an simple, configurable connection pool for
   `SQLClient` instances.

 * **ConnectionFactory** - an "abstract" base class that defines the
   methods you'll need to implement to support a specific database.

   Specifically, you'll need to implement:

     - `open_connection`
     - `close_connection`
     - `execute`

   Once defined, a `ConnectionFactory` can be dropped right in to the
   `SQLClient` and `SQLClientPool` types to aquire the interface and
   functionality they provide.

### Database-Specific Types

The *sql-client* module bundles support for several database
platforms.

These clients are generally implemented as thin wrappers around
existing database-specific client modules.

Those database-specific modules are declared as `devDependencies` in
this module's `package.json` file, and hence are not needed at
runtime.

When `sql-client` is `require`d, it will test to see if the requisite
client libraries are available.  The database-specific components of
*sql-client* will only be loaded (and exported) if the underlying
libraries they depend upon are available.

Hence, for example, the `PostgreSQLClient` and `PostgreSQLClientPool`
classes depend on
[*node-postgres*](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres).

To use *sql-client* with PostgreSQL, you'll need to install both
*node-postgres* (`npm install pg`) and *sql-client* (`npm install
sql-client`).  In your `package.json` file, that would look something
like this:

    {
      "dependencies": {
        "pg": "latest",
        "sql-client": "latest"
      },
      "...":"...and so on..."
    }

 * **PostgreSQLClient** / **PostgreSQLClientPool** -
   a `ConnectionFactory` implementation that wraps
   [**node-postgres**](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres)

 * **MySQLClient** / **MySQLClientClientPool** -
   a `ConnectionFactory` implementation that wraps
   [**mysql**](https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql/)

## Hacking

While not strictly required, you are *strongly* encouraged to take
advantage of the [`Makefile`](./Makefile) when working on this module.

[`make`](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a *very* widely
supported tool for dependency management and conditional compilation.

### Obtaining Make

`make` is probably pre-installed on your Linux or Unix distribution (if
not, you can use `rpm`, `yum`, `apt-get`, etc. to install it).

On Mac OSX, one simple way to add `make` to your system is to install
the Apple Developer Tools from <https://developer.apple.com/>.

On Windows, you can install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/),
[GNUWin](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) or
[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), among other sources.

### Basics


With `make` installed, run:

    make clean test

to download any missing dependencies, compile anything that needs to
be compiled and run the unit test suite.

Run:

    make docs

to generate various documentation artifacts, largely but not
exclusively in the `docs` directory.

### Using the Makefile

From this project's root directory (the directory containing this
file), type `make help` to see a list of common targets, including:

 * `make install` - download and install all external dependencies.

 * `make clean` - remove all generated files.

 * `make test` - run the unit-test suite.

 * `make bin` - generate the executable scripts in `./bin`.

 * `make docs` - generate HTML documentation from markdown files and
   annotated source code.

 * `make docco` - generate an HTML rendering of the annotated source
   code into the `docs/docco` directory.

 * `make coverage` - generate a test-coverage report (to the file
   `docs/coverage.html`).

 * `make module` - package the module for upload to npm.

 * `make test-module-install` - generates an npm module from this
   repository and validates that it can be installed using npm.

## How to contribute

Your contributions,
[bug reports](https://github.com/intellinote/sql-client/issues) and
[pull-requests](https://github.com/intellinote/sql-client/pulls) are
greatly appreciated.

We're happy to accept any help you can offer, but the following
guidelines can help streamline the process for everyone.

 * You can report any bugs at
   [github.com/intellinote/sql-client/issues](https://github.com/intellinote/sql-client/issues).

    - We'll be able to address the issue more easily if you can
      provide an demonstration of the problem you are
      encountering. The best format for this demonstration is a
      failing unit test (like those found in
      [./test/](https://github.com/intellinote/sql-client/tree/master/test)),
      but your report is welcome with or without that.

 * Our preferered channel for contributions or changes to the source
   code and documentation is as a Git "patch" or "pull-request".

    - If you've never submitted a pull-request, here's one way to go
      about it:

        1. Fork or clone the repository.
        2. Create a local branch to contain your changes (`git
           checkout -b my-new-branch`).
        3. Make your changes and commit them to your local repository.
        4. Create a pull request
           [as described here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

    - If you'd rather use a private (or just non-GitHub) repository,
      you might find
      [these generic instructions on creating a "patch" with Git](https://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/)
      helpful.

 * If you are making changes to the code please ensure that the
   [unit test suite](./test) still passes.

 * If you are making changes to the code to address a bug or introduce
   new features, we'd *greatly* appreciate it if you can provide one
   or more [unit tests](./test) that demonstrate the bug or exercise
   the new feature.

**Please Note:** We'd rather have a contribution that doesn't follow
these guidelines than no contribution at all.  If you are confused or
put-off by any of the above, your contribution is still welcome.  Feel
free to contribute or comment in whatever channel works for you.
